# Pomodoro-Timer

<h1>
A simple pomodoro timer for the pomodoro technique when studying.</h1>

<p>
This timer will allow you to set your own timers for each of the pomodoro sessions and the amount of breaks you want to take before the 30 minute break. The app will play the runescape intro song when your break has begun and motivation by Mike Epps when your break is over. The timer sounds can be changed by changing the Audio objects file path in index.js.

<h2> Known bugs </h2>
Currently, by constantly clicking on "start" you will make the timer decrease faster and increase the current session count.
